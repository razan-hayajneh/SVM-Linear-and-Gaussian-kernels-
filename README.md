# SVM-Linear-and-Gaussian-kernels-
implement a SVM model that predicts for SVM dataset file (consists of TWO Features and One Output) using Linear and Gaussian Kernels.



when implementing with linear kernel the best value for C = 20 for my dataset, but still the linear is bad choice (don't work and has big error) for this dataset.



when implementing with Gaussian kernel the best value for C = 20 and gamma = 100 for my dataset, and the result is perfect (without error), so the best SVM model for SVM dataset file by using Gaussian Kernel with C = 20 and gamma = 100
